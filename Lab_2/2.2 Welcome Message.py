# 2.2 Write a script that prints your name, department, and a welcome message
# Get input from user (as per 2.2 header, though example code hardcodes it, I'll allow input per 'Get input from user' comment in manual, OR just follow the code)
# The manual image (Page 5) shows:
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# department = input("Enter your department: ")
# ...
name = input("Enter your name: ")
department = input("Enter your department: ")

# Display welcome message
print("\nWelcome to the Python Programming Course!")
print("Name:", name)
print("Department:", department)
print("We're glad to have you here.")
