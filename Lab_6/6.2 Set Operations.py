# 6.2 Find union and intersection of two sets
# Define two sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Find union
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print("Union:", union_set) # Manual code didn't print it but implied. I'll print it.

# Note: Manual title asks for Intersection too, but code only shows Union. I'll add Intersection.
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
